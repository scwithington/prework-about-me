      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I took a game design course each year in highschool but I was never a programmer. It interested me so I took part in an internship with my high school's IT department working with code in terminal, helping to wipe and re-image all of the school computers for next year. I feel like that is where I discovered my liking for coding.</p>
